# Hologram Particles VFX

A real-time hologram particle effect built with Three.js WebGPU, TSL Node Shaders, and Next.js.
This repository is a free open-source resource for the creative development community.

It includes a fully interactive **3D Playground** to explore every parameter of the effect in real time — particle count, lighting, noise displacement, mouse interaction, model morphing, bloom, and more.

## ✨ What is this?

**Hologram Particles VFX** is a production-quality WebGPU particle system that turns any GLB model into an animated holographic cloud of 60,000 instanced spheres.
It is designed as a learning resource and a starting point for similar VFX in interactive 3D projects.

Key highlights:

- **TSL Node Shaders** — all GPU logic written in JavaScript, no GLSL files
- **WebGPU native** — runs on Three.js r182 WebGPU renderer
- **Any GLB** — load your own model via drag & drop, particles adapt automatically
- **Live model morphing** — smooth three-phase transition between GLB models
- **Fully parametric** — every visual property exposed via real-time GUI
- **Zero external shader libraries** — everything is hand-written in TSL

## ⚡ Particle System Features

### Geometry
- **InstancedMesh** — 60,000 icosahedron spheres rendered in a single draw call
- **GLB surface sampling** — positions and normals sampled via `MeshSurfaceSampler`, distributed proportionally by triangle area
- **Dual normal blending** — per-particle blend between figure surface normal and sphere local normal for micro-volume shading

### Shading (TSL)
- **Wrapped diffuse lighting** — two-light model with softened terminator (`wrap` parameter)
- **Volume strength** — blends figure macro-normal with sphere micro-normal for physical roundness
- **Fractal noise displacement** — `mx_fractal_noise_vec3` drives particle animation along surface normals
- **Animated noise mask** — controls which particles displace and by how much

### Mouse Interaction
- **Particle displacement** — particles pushed outward from cursor within a configurable radius
- **Spring-damper physics** — per-particle return simulation with tunable stiffness and damping
- **Dual glow system** — passive proximity glow + active velocity-driven glow with independent decay
- **Camera spring** — XY translation + Z roll driven by cursor NDC position

### Model Morphing
- **Three-phase state machine** — deform out → morph → reform
- **GPU lerp** — `mix(current, target, progress)` uniform drives all 60k particles simultaneously
- **Transition glow** — particles with greatest displacement bloom brightest during morph
- **Noise mask dissolve** — organic non-uniform deform controlled by mask contrast

### Scene Elements
- **Cylinder** — transparent Fresnel edge glow tube framing the figure
- **Halo rings** — two pairs of rotating arcs at top and bottom of cylinder
- **Dot grid** — animated floor grid with wave brightness

### Post-processing
- **Bloom** — WebGPU native bloom node, luminance-threshold with tunable strength and radius

## 🔍 Debug Modes

Built-in debug visualizations for breakdown and presentation:

| Button | Mode | Shows |
|--------|------|-------|
| `WF` | Wireframe | Edge geometry of the loaded GLB |
| `FLAT` | Flat | Raw particle density, no lighting |
| `NRM` | Normals | Surface normals as RGB color |
| `NOI` | Noise | Raw fractal noise field as grayscale |
| `LIT` | Lit | Combined grayscale diffuse + ambient |
| `L1` | Light 1 | Light 1 contribution only |
| `L2` | Light 2 | Light 2 contribution only |

All debug modes hide scene decorations (cylinder, rings, grid, header) for clean capture.
